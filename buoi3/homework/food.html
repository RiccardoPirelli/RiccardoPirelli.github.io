        There’s nowhere quite like Italy when it comes to ice creams (or gelato,
        as the locals would call it). Italy is renowned the world over for its
        ice creams and there isn’t a single city or town you’ll visit in Italy
        where you won’t find some homemade ice cream parlour. It’s one of my
        favourite things about Italy and judging from the reactions on here (and
        on Instagram), I’m not alone on this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Randomly, I just found out that the very first ice creams were invented
        in Ancient Greece where snow was mixed with honey and fruit in Athens to
        give ancient ice creams. (Similar things happens across the world in
        different places over 2,000 years ago!)

      <h2>Look out for the colours.</h2>
      <img
        src="https://i0.wp.com/handluggageonly.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hand-Luggage-Only-2-2-1.jpg?w=483&h=724&ssl=1"

      />
      <p>
        Pistachio, in particular, is an important one as it’s an expensive nut
        as so lower quality ice cream parlours tend to use different nuts (e.g.
        almonds) to make the ice cream and just add in artificial colouring
        and/or flavouring.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Check the consistency</h2>
      <img
        src="https://i2.wp.com/handluggageonly.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3181.jpg?w=495&h=330&ssl=1"

      />
      <p>
        Point is, good gelato tends to lose its shape when piled high and just
        tend to fall back flat whereas the lower quality ones will hold their
        shape a lot more (very much like most of your store-bought ice creams).
      </p>
      <p class="special-text">
        *For the uninitiated – honey is more viscous than water and gelato is
        more viscous than honey.
