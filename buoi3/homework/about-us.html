      <h2>How ‘Hand Luggage Only’ Began…</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="text">
        As a hare-brained challenge at University… Just kidding!!! Hand Luggage
        Only was born back in April 2014 on a surprisingly warm afternoon in
        Yaya’s college room at University of Cambridge. In what seemed like an
        oasis of calm between assignments, Yaya and Lloyd (that’s us!) were
        talking about sharing our travel stories and photos with others
        like-minded travellers on the internet. We’d already been doing this for
        a while and (almost competitively) sharing our stories on Facebook but
        what we really wanted was to connect with other travellers across the
        globe and have a two-way conversation about travel.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        On that fateful day in Cambridge in true Yaya style (i.e. impatient), we
        started writing blog posts, using photos we’d already edited and within
        a few hours, www.HandLuggageOnly.co.uk was online and ready to go!

      <h2>Who’s Yaya?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="text">
        Let’s see…. How would I describe myself? T.D.H. – Tall Dark and
        Handsome! Again… JUST KIDDING! I would probably describe myself as
        someone who knows no limits with his favourite foods (I can literally
        eat to the point of shame). I am swirling mass of contradictions, I love
        a good boogie but I have the worst taste in music (example 1) and some
        people describe me as smart/clever (due to my grades) but on the other
        hand, I’m incredibly clueless about a lot of things (like how I couldn’t
        point out where Singapore was on a map until the day I actually moved to
        Singapore – example 2). I am working on the cluelessness part though and
        I’m hoping you can help me out with that one.
