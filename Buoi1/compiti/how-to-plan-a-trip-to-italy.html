      <p>Welcome! My <b>name is Katy</b>  and ever sin<sub>ce</sub> I first visited 20 years ago I have been plotting my <u>next trip to Italy</u>. From its <i>hist<sup>oric</sup> cities to the mountains</i> , lakes and coast, I fell in love with this beautiful country and want to help you do the same.</p>
      <p>Flying direct (or with a single stop) to Italy from most places in the world is easy. Most visitors fly into <strong>Rome Fiumicino</strong> but you can also easily fly into Milan Malpensa (MXP) or (<abbr title="Venice Marco Polo">VCE</abbr>) airports from major hubs around the world. <blockquote> <bdo dir="ltr">There are many other airports throughout the country that can be accessed within Italy and Europe</bdo></blockquote>
