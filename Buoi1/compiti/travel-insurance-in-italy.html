      <p>Do you need travel insurance for Italy? Yes, you do.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how careful you are, things can and do go wrong when you
        travel. Even in a relatively safe country like Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>You’d be surprised how many trips are canceled</u> due to emergencies
        at home or the number of people who fall on cobblestones and sprain
        their ankles.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it is best to be prepared to avoid any unnecessary stress by taking
        out a comprehensive travel insurance policy.
